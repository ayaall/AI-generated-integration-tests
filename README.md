# AI-generated-integration-tests

# Project Description
This project is part of a research initiative that investigates the automation of integration test generation using artificial intelligence (AI). The goal is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of integration testing in software development by comparing AI-generated tests with traditional human-written ones. This study evaluates the AI-generated tests based on criteria such as code coverage, readability, usability, and correctness.
